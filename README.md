# AR_TICTACTOE
 Two player using Photon 2 PUN2
 
 ARCore based (Was planning to use cloud anchor) but will be waiting for
 ARFoundation to support this and rather try out Azure Spatial Anchors in another project.
 
 Be sure to import PUN2 from asset store and get an PUN application key to put in your project
